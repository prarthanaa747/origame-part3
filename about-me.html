   <h3>What is origami?
       </h3>
        
        <p>it is the art of folding paper into a sculpture without using glue or scissors. This may seem like a daunting task, but it's entirely possible to fold paper into very sophistocated and beautiful designs.
            Most origami instructions and diagrams here will be easy in order to not discourage you, but feel free to tackle the harder ones if you feel daring want some challenge.
            There are many shapes to choose from so pick a category from the menu. Once you select a shape, you'll be presented with the origami instructions and diagrams for it. Have fun:)</p2>
